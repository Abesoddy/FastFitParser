FastFitParser
=============

New, much faster implementation of a FIT parser in C#. 

Revision 0.3.0

- Added declarations for all of the field types and messages that are 
  a) generated by my Garmin 800 and b) defined in the SDK. There are some
  undefined records and fields that are generated by the Garmin 800, but 
  which aren't defined in the ANT+ SDK.

- Breaking changes happen here. The major one is building a reflection-like
  mechanism to dump the schema of .fit files for inspection. This requires
  looking up fields by field number, which couldn't really be done effectively
  using enums. I switched to a system of static fields in static classes that
  give similar results to enums, but which also allow me to add some additional
  data to each field declaration such as whether it is an enum or not.
